# Regression Metrics 
## Using Forest Fires Data 
* This notebook builds upon linear regression knowledge with the Scikit-Learnn library - building upon fitting linaer regression models, identifying candidates for independent variables, and assessing validity through the assumptions of linear regression models - into detailing how to measure the performance of regression models * . 

* The dataset utilized contains burned area of forest fires in the northeast region of Portugal in addition to other attribute information including month, day, temperature, humidity, wind, etc. * 

## Overview 

### Building MLR Models to Predict Area Affected by Forest Fires
- Leveraging the Scikit-Learn library to build two different MLR models by : 
  - Define X and Y variables
  - Performing a train/test split
  - Fitting model on training data 
  - Making predictions on testing data 


### Regression Metrics 
- Characterizing and defining the goals for six different regression metrics
  - Mean Squared Error
  - Root Meann Squared Error
  - Mean Squared Log Error
  - Mean Squared Absolute Errot
  - $R^2$ Score  
  - Adjusted $R^2$ Score  
- Calculating regression metrics for the two MLR models built 

### Model Picking Based on Regression Metrics
- Comparing the regresssion metrics for the two MLR models built to determine the best performing model
